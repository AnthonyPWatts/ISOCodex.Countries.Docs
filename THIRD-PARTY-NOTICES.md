CLDR data is copyright Unicode, Inc. and is released under the Unicode License v3.

The package uses CLDR territory code mappings and English territory display names to build a current ISO-style country and territory registry. It excludes deprecated territory aliases, CLDR pseudo-territories, regional groupings, unknown-region placeholders, and user-assigned code elements that are not ISO 3166-1 assigned country entries from the current-country registry.

The package also uses selected CLDR locale display-name files to build country display-name data, `territoryAlias` metadata to build explicit alias lookup data, CLDR special territory display names to build the code-element registry, and CLDR subdivision validity data and English subdivision display names to build the subdivision registry.
